# Digit-Recognizer-traditional-ML
In this notebook I have tried to perform Classification task on MNIST digit recognizer dataset. Though better models have been made using deep learning CNN (like here -https://www.kaggle.com/nickelkumawat/digit-recognizer-cnn-keras).

In this notebook I will explicity use NON DL and CNN methods. In last we can see that appreciable accuracy could be achieved using traditional ML models too which are often ignored.
